          Hi everyone, I am originally from the Houston area.<br>
          I moved to San Antonio to attend UTSA to major in Computer Science.<br>
          My favorite colors are magenta and blue. I wear lots of hats and prefer shorts to pants.<br>
          I went to Dulles High School in the Sugar Land area and grew up in a very diverse environment.<br>
          I also play different instruments and sing.<br>
          Some of those instruments include: the keyboard, melodica, and guitar.<br>
          I am a fan of music and the radio.<br>
          The coolest station and show is Indie Overnight hosted by the Trinity University students,<br>
          you can tune in to cool jams starting at 10pm on 91.7FM.<br>
